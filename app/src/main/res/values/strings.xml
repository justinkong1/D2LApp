You can create your own mobile app, or you can choose CS4322 Mobile App (see below).\n
<b>CS4322 Mobile App</b>\n
<b>Description:</b>\n
This project is to develop an Android Mobile App to access the learning material of this course. The mobile app should mimic the organization of the course material in the same modular way as in the D2L web course system. The specifications include:\n
1. A top-level module “Start Here” with sub-modules:\n
a. “Welcome”\n
b. “Syllabus”\n
c. “Lab Report Instruction”\n
d. “Project Instruction”\n
2. Another top-level module, “Learning Modules”, with 13 lesson sub-modules, and each sub-module has two children sub-modules:\n
a. “Slides”\n
b. “Lab”\n
User registration and authentication (This can be implemented as the last step since we will talk about the data and security in the last week, but you are highly encouraged to do your research to have it done in advance.)\n
You are allowed to be creative in the UI designs.\n
<b>Submissions:</b>\n
1. A midterm report (presentation slides) that should include\n
a. A mock design of all the UI.\n
b. The flowchart of the coding-level design with classes/functions, if possible.\n
2. A final report (presentation slides) that should include\n
a. The complete implementation\n
b. A prototype App to demo\n
<i>The report presentations are scheduled as in the syllabus.</i>\n
<b>Grading Rubrics:</b>\n
1. UI Aesthetics (25%)\n
2. UI Friendliness (25%)\n
3. Functionalities (40%)\n
4. Presentation and Communications (10%)\n
